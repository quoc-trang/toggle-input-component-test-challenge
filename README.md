# Toggle Input Component Test Challenge

Your task is to create a component test for the `ToggleInput` component we created earlier in the training.

## Requirements

1. Test that the v-model value correctly toggles between `true` and `false` when the component is clicked

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Feel free to use TypeScript to make your component test type safe if you'd like. This is NOT required however.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Run the tests with `yarn test:unit`
